# Square AI Merchant Copilot
An AI native decision assistant for Square sellers

## Overview
AI Merchant Copilot is an AI powered assistant designed to help Square sellers make better day to day business decisions without requiring time spent analyzing dashboards or reports.

Small and mid sized merchants generate large amounts of commerce data through point of sale transactions, inventory systems, staffing schedules, and payment methods such as Buy Now Pay Later. However, most sellers lack the time or analytical background to turn that data into action.

This project explores how AI can be embedded directly into seller workflows to provide clarity, confidence, and economic empowerment.

---

## Target User
AI Merchant Copilot is built for:
- Small and mid sized business owners using Square
- Sellers managing inventory, staffing, and cash flow
- Merchants with limited time and limited data expertise

Examples include cafes, retail shops, salons, and food trucks.

---

## Problem Statement
Square sellers consistently face three challenges:

**Operational blind spots**  
Sellers do not always know which products are about to stock out, which items are underperforming, or which days are overstaffed.

**Cash flow uncertainty**  
Revenue may look healthy while timing of expenses creates stress and limits hiring or inventory decisions.

**Cognitive overload**  
Dashboards show data but require interpretation. Sellers need answers, not charts.

---

## Solution
AI Merchant Copilot acts as a conversational decision layer on top of commerce data.

Instead of asking sellers to analyze dashboards, the Copilot:
- Monitors sales, inventory, and payment behavior
- Surfaces insights proactively
- Answers questions in plain language
- Recommends actions with clear reasoning

The goal is not automation for its own sake, but confidence at the moment of decision.

## Core Features

### Conversational Business Insights
Sellers can ask natural language questions such as:
- What should I restock this week?
- Why did sales dip last Friday?
- Can I afford to hire another employee next month?

The Copilot responds using recent trends, inventory velocity, and historical patterns.

---

### Inventory Forecasting
The system predicts near term stockouts and highlights slow moving inventory.

Example insight:  
"You are likely to run out of oat milk in five days. Reordering forty units would prevent lost sales next weekend."

---

### Cash Flow Advisor
The Copilot provides a rolling thirty, sixty, and ninety day cash flow outlook and explains changes in simple language.

Example insight:  
"Your cash balance will dip below target in three weeks due to supplier payments. Promoting Buy Now Pay Later on top selling items could help smooth cash flow."

---

### Actionable Alerts
Instead of passive dashboards, the Copilot pushes concise recommendations such as:
- Enable Buy Now Pay Later on selected products to increase average order size
- Reduce staffing on low demand days
- Adjust pricing on stable demand items with rising costs

Each recommendation includes context and expected impact.

---

## Why This Matters
This project aligns with Square’s mission of economic empowerment by:
- Lowering the cognitive cost of running a business
- Making embedded financial services easier to use
- Helping sellers act proactively instead of reacting to surprises
- Demonstrating how AI can augment human decision making

---

## AI Native Approach
AI is treated as a core product capability rather than an add on.

Guiding principles:
- AI reduces friction instead of adding complexity
- Recommendations are explainable and reversible
- Silence is preferred over low confidence suggestions
- Human judgment remains central

---

## Technical Overview
This prototype uses a lightweight architecture to prioritize product thinking over infrastructure complexity.

- Frontend: Simple web based dashboard
- Backend: API driven services
- Data: Mock point of sale and inventory data
- AI Layer: Language model based analysis and summarization

---

## Metrics for Success
If shipped, success would be measured by:
- Percentage of recommendations acted upon
- Reduction in inventory stockouts
- Increase in Buy Now Pay Later usage
- Merchant engagement and retention
- Reduction in operational support questions

---

## What Was Intentionally Out of Scope
To maintain focus, the following were excluded from the MVP:
- Full accounting integrations
- Automated purchasing without seller approval
- Advanced machine learning pipelines
- Complex configuration screens

These represent future opportunities rather than day one requirements.

---

## Future Roadmap
- Personalized recommendation confidence thresholds
- Experiment driven alert optimization
- Ethical guardrails for financial suggestions
- Industry specific Copilot modes
- Multilingual support

---

## Demo
A short Loom walkthrough demonstrates:
- The seller problem being solved
- Core user flows
- Live AI interactions
- Product decisions and tradeoffs

---

## Closing Thought
AI Merchant Copilot explores how AI can act as a trusted partner for sellers. The goal is not to overwhelm users with intelligence, but to give them clarity at the moments that matter most.
